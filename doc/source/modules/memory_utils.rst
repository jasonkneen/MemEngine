Memory Utilities
=================

We implement extra utilities as auxiliary components, loosely coupled with above modules. We implement a storage module as a database to save the contents of information. We also provide a display module to visualize the specific contents inside the memory. Besides, we provide a client module to utilize MemEngine through remote deployment on a server implemented by fastAPI.
