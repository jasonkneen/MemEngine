Overview
===============

The framework of our library is present in the following figure.

- The foundational layer consists of the memory function, which implements basic functions as standard support for various memory operations.
- The intermediate layer comprises memory operations, which refer to fundamental processes that form different memory methods.
- The uppermost layer features the memory model, which encompasses various existing research models that can be easily utilized by different agents. Additionally, we provide a configuration module that allows for easy modification of hyper-parameters and prompts at different levels. A utility module is also implemented to enhance the saving and demonstration of memory contents.
